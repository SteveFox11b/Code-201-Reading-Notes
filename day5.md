        <li> CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.

        <li> It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties.
        <li> Block level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into black level boxes.

        <li> A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.
        <li> Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.
        <li> Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.
        <li> Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.
        <li> JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text) and Boolean values (true or false).
        <li> Expressions evaluate into a single value.
        <li> Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

        <li> Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.
        <li> Comparison operators (===, !==, !=, <,>,<=, =v.) are used to compare two operands.
        <li> Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
        <li> if...else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
        <li> Switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match).
        <li> Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
        <li> All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
        <li> There are three types of loop: for, while, and do...while. Each represents a set of statements.
