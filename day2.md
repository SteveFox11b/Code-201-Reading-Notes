    <p>
    <li> HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
    <li>They also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).
       
  <h3>Introducing CSS pgs 226-245</h3>
        <li> CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
        <li> Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).
