    <p>
    <li> HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
    <li>They also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).
       
  <h2>Introducing CSS pgs 226-245</h2>
        <li> CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
        <li> Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).
        <li> Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
        <li> Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of the font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
        <li> CSS rules usually appear in a seperate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.
            
  <h2>Basic JavaScript Instructions pgs 53-84</h2>
        <li> A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.
        <li> Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.
        <li> Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.
        <li> Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.
        <li> JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text) and Boolean values (true or false).
        <li> Expressions evaluate into a single value.
        <li> Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.
          
  <h2>Decisions and Loops pgs 145-182</h2>
        <li> Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.
        <li> Comparison operators (===, !==, !=, <,>,<=, =v.) are used to compare two operands.
        <li> Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
        <li> if...else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
        <li> Switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match).
        <li> Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
        <li> All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
        <li> There are three types of loop: for, while, and do...while. Each represents a set of statements.
