# Reading Notes Day 1
## HTML and CSS

### Chapter 1 Structure  (pgs.12-39)

  Html pages are text documents
  
  Html uses tags <> characters that sit inside angled brackets to give information they surround special meaning.
  
  Tags are often referred to as elements
  
  Tags usually come in pairs, opening tag denotes the start of a peice of content; the closingtag denotes the end.
  
  Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
  
  Attribues require a name and a value.
  
  To learn HTML you need to know what tags are availible for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.
